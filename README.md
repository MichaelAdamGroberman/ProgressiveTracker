#### Progressive Budget Tracker

[Deployed App](https://serene-depths-69227.herokuapp.com)
THe assignment was to turn some premade code into a PWA. This means the app functions regularlly, even if the end-user's client loses connectivity to the application. All changes are cached locally, and then a sync happens oncee the application reconnects to the internet.
